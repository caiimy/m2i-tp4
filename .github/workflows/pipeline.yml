# This is a basic workflow to help you get started with Actions

# Controls when the workflow will run
on:
  # Triggers the workflow on push or pull request events but only for the "main" branch
  # push:
  #   branches: [ "main" ]
  # pull_request:
  #   branches: [ "main" ]

  # Allows you to run this workflow manually from the Actions tab

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
